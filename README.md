## My background

I am an engineer with a Msc in Computation in Coastal & Civil Engineering from the university of Pau and l’Adour countries in France, with an engineering degree  in Hydraulic from the National Polytechnic School in Algeria.

-Worked in the consulting field for around 2 years as a Water/Energy consultant. 

-Developed a strong background working as a data scientist on the application of machine learning and data science methods in water ,energy and environmental field throughut different projects.

-Gained a  valuable experience using numerical models for wave modeling, wave structure interaction (FSI), and wave overtopping and hydraulic modeling in general.

-Being involved in many projects related to coastal/Water data analysis.

-Solid understanding of machine learning algorithms such as deep learning algorithms used for time series analysis, supervised and unsupervised learning..etc. 

Some of my main projects are:
- Energy optimization of wastewater treatment plants using gradient boosting algorithms
- Prediction of water wave characteristics using machine learning methods (LSTM, CNN) and compared with results of numerical model SWAN.
